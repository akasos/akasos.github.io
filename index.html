                    and maintains avionics software for the F-16. Work life involves coding in C and C++ and writing an occasional
                    Bash or Perl script here or there. On the daily, we do regression testing, code functional testing, document 
                    re-writes, code changes and everything else that is needed to keep the pilots happy and flying.

            <p class="job-description">At FedEx I did what you probably think I did. I did pickups and deliveries.
                                       During the evenings I would help load out-bound packages into cans
                                       to be sent off to the airport for further processing. I was also a Dangerous Good's Specialist which
                                       involved me making sure no hazardous materials were unfit for travel.
                                       On top of all that I drove like a champ and was accident-free for the entire 3 year's I worked there.

            <p class="job-description">Working as an Umpire I would call it as I saw it. I officiated both Little League and Adult Slow Pitch Softball
                                       during my summer breaks from school. Most nights were fun but occasionally I would have to put up with that one parent who
                                       questioned your every call against their kid or even that one player who would have went pro if it werent for his high school coach
                                       not liking him but who is now having to play slow pitch instead.

            <p class="job-description"> I started my young career bagging and helping customers with their grociers out to their cars.  
                                        I eventually moved my way around and worked in the general merchandise department stocking shelves,
                                        roatating product and writing orders before making the switch to Produce. Working in Produce I would clean, trim and rotate items
                                        in order to keep my department smelling fresh as a dasiy. Every now and again I would have a customer ask for my assistance in helping them to pick
                                        out a watermelon only to have them never asking for my help again...I still have yet to master that skill.
